# monopoly


This code demonstrates the most basic implementation of the Monopoly board game.



This implementation can barely be called "Monopoly" as in the classic understanding of the board game. However, it simulates a turn-based system which prevents players from "moving" their pawns till they reach their turn. It also simulates the dice, where the system returns a random number between 1 and 6 which will decide how far the pawn will move once the system receives input from a player.



This implementation supports up to 5 clients (each client can be simulated by opening a new browser tab with the website open).
